# The Roasting House ☕

**Live Demo:** [https://the-roasting-house.vercel.app/](https://the-roasting-house.vercel.app/)

A full-stack **Coffee Shop Web Application** built using the **MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js)** with **Redux** for global state management.  
This platform allows customers to explore coffee products, manage carts, and place orders online — while admins can easily handle menu, inventory, and order analytics through a responsive dashboard.
